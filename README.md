# ESP4S2
ESP8266 NodeMCU Lua for MIT Scratch 2

## Introduction
The aim of this project is giving microcontrollers control into hand of kids. MIT Scratch or Roboremo can be used as user interface. 
Components:
* Scratch 2 Offline Editor: a programming interface
  * Scratch extension written in Python as a bridge between Scratch and ESP8266
  * Python interpreter
* Roboremo: a simple control interface on Android
* ESP8266: microcontroller with built-in WiFi
  * NodeMCU firmware
  * Client written in Lua
